**Inventory & Purchase Data Analysis**

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing inventory and purchase data to improve inventory management efficiency. Using Python, the analysis covers Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), ABC classification, Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Reorder Point (ROP) calculations, and demand forecasting. The project also includes data visualizations for better interpretation and insights.

**Features**

**->** Data cleaning and preprocessing of purchase and inventory datasets

**->** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

**->** ABC classification for inventory prioritization

**->** EOQ and ROP calculations for order optimization

**->** Demand forecasting using time series analysis

**->** Step-by-step explanations with Jupyter Notebook

**Tech Stack**

Python(Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels)

Jupyter Notebook
